# DeSign


This repo is based on [VAC (ICCV21)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Min_Visual_Alignment_Constraint_for_Continuous_Sign_Language_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html), [TLP (ECCV22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08734). Many thanks for their great work!


## Prerequisites

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (better >=1.13 to be compatible with ctcdecode or these may exist errors). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)ï¼Œfor beam search decode. (ctcdecode is only supported on the Linux platform.)

- [Optional] sclite [[kaldi-asr/kaldi]](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), install kaldi tool to get sclite for evaluation. After installation, create a soft link toward the sclite: 
  `mkdir ./software`
  `ln -s PATH_TO_KALDI/tools/sctk-2.4.10/bin/sclite ./software/sclite`

   You may use the python version evaluation tool for convenience (by setting 'evaluate_tool' as 'python' in line 16 of ./configs/baseline.yaml), but sclite can provide more detailed statistics.

- You can install other required modules by conducting 
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Preparation

### PHOENIX2014 dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/). 

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/phoenix2014-release ./dataset/phoenix2014`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### PHOENIX2014-T dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/PHOENIX-2014-T-release-v3/PHOENIX-2014-T ./dataset/phoenix2014-T`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python dataset_preprocess-T.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### Training/Testing

The priorities of configuration files are: command line > config file > default values of argparse. To train the SLR model, run the command below:

`python main.py --config ./config/baseline.yaml --device your_device`
